Again, Anh and I started early which was very helpful. 

On the first day we met, we spent most of the time working on reading in the user input and the putting the symbols in the correct deque. Then, we were easily able to make the calculations needed for postfix. 

The second time we met, we worked on writing the code for infix. This was a much harder task as we did not even think about how we were going to abide by the rules of PEMDAS. However, after much consideration, we decided to make our "level system" which you will see above. This was a great fix to our problem, but we spent about an hour trying different methods before that idea fell on our lap. So, that was pretty frustrating. 

When we finished with our operator precedence, we still had the problem of including the parentheses! We kept running into issues with the right one, specifically as we also tried to plan for when the user did not close the parentheses. 

Thus came the worst portion of it all, the error throwing portion. It made me want to bang my head against the wall. First, we had a hard time classifying what kind of errors each test case was. Then, we couldn't really figure out how to implement them correctly (what the heck am I supposed to import. I still don't know). To be totally honest, I never want to look at a throw keyword or try catch method again. 

Either way, after hours spent with the TAs, we figured it out.

After this all we had left was to connect the Postfix class to the Calculate class which was pretty straightforward. We tried a bunch of test cases to make sure our code was working correctly and it seems like we are in good shape. I feel confident in the work we are turning in this week as we worked very hard on it and I believe we hit all of our bases! 

If I had longer time, I wish I could have implemented proper tests like we did in the last couple of assignments.

In summation, while I love CS, this assignment certainly tested my limits. I'm not a huge fan of having to predict and correct user errors, but I do realize that it's important that I got this practice and understanding. 

Next time, I want to give ourselves some more breaks so that our working can be more efficient.
